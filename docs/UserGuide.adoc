== Introduction

Module Planner is for NUS Computer Science undergraduate students who *prefer to use a desktop app* to keep track of past modules and list possible future modules based on the academic requirements. More importantly, Module Planner is optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Module Planner can get your module planning tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `moduleplanner.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Module Planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`add`**`y/1 s/1 c/CS1231 c/MA1521` : adds modules CS1231 and MA1521 to the year 1 semester 1 modules list.
* **`delete`**`c/CS1231` : deletes module CS1231 from the Module Planner.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you can supply, e.g. in `suggest y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`, `YEAR` and `SEMESTER` are parameters which can be used as `suggest y/1 s/1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `setup ... [f/FOCUS_AREA]` can be used as `setup ... f/software engineering` or as `setup ...`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `MODULE_CODE...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `CS1231`, `CS1231 MA1521` etc.
====

=== Adding modules: `add`

Adds the specified modules to the list of modules that you have taken or want to take for the specified year and semester. +
Format: `add y/YEAR s/SEMESTER c/MODULE_CODE...`

[TIP]
You can add 1 or more modules.

Examples:

* `add y/1 s/1 c/MA1101R`
* `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1231 c/CS1101S`

=== Deleting modules : `delete`

Deletes the specified modules from list of current or future modules for the specified year and semester. +
Format: `delete c/MODULE_CODE...`

Examples:

* `delete c/CS1010`
* `delete c/CS1231 c/MA1521`

=== Finding information on a module : `find`

Retrieves the information of the specified module. +
Format: `find c/MODULE_CODE`

Example:

* `find c/CS1010`

=== Going to a different year and semester : `goto`

Changes the view to the specified year and semester. +
Format: `goto y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`

Example:

* `goto y/1 s/1`

=== Listing modules : `list`

If a valid year is supplied, shows a list of all modules that you have added to that year. Otherwise, shows a list of all modules that you have taken in every semester. +
Format: `list [y/YEAR]`

[TIP]
====
* This command is NOT undoable.
* The list of modules will be automatically updated upon adding or deleting module(s).
====

[NOTE]
====
* A valid year must be an integer from 1 to 4 inclusive.
* If no modules have been added to a specified year or no modules have been added to ModulePlanner, will show an empty list.
====

Examples:

* `list y/1` +
Lists all modules added to year 1, both semester 1 and 2 (if they exist).

* `list` +
Lists all modules added to every semester, from year 1 semester 1 to year 4 semester 2 (if they exist).

=== Setting user profile : `setup`

Initialises your profile with your major and optional focus areas to allow personalisation. +
Format: `setup m/MAJOR [f/FOCUS_AREA]...`

[NOTE]
The major and focus areas should be spelt out in full. +
Currently, this feature only supports the major of Computer Science and the focus areas of Algorithms and Theory,
Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. Support for other majors and focus areas will come beyond v1.2.

Examples:

* `setup y/1 s/1 m/computer science f/software engineering`

=== Getting status update : `status`

Shows how many core, unrestricted electives, and general education modules that you have taken and how many more you need to take. +
Format: `status`

=== Suggesting modules : `suggest`

If a valid year and semester are supplied, suggests a list of modules that you are available to take in the specified year and semester, based on modules that you have added. A module is available for you if:

* You have fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) all the prerequisites of the module in the semester(s) prior to the one you specified.
* You have not fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) any preclusions to the module in any semester (including semester after the one you specified).
* You have not fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) the module in any semester (including semester after the one you specified).

The list of modules is sorted, with core modules being on top, followed by general education modules and unrestricted electives modules.

Format: `suggest y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`

[TIP]
====
* This command is NOT undoable.
* The list of suggested modules will be automatically updated upon adding or deleting module(s).
====

[NOTE]
====
* A valid year must be an integer from 1 to 4 inclusive.
* A valid semester is either 1 or 2.
====

Examples:

* `suggest y/1 s/1`

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

Module Planner data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Module Planner folder.
