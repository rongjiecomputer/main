== PROJECT: ModulePlanner

---

== Overview

This project portfolio showcases the contributions I have made in a team project under CS2103T. We developed a product called ModulePlanner on top of an existing software, AddressBook - Level 4.

ModulePlanner is a desktop application made to help NUS Computer Science undergraduate students plan their modules by giving module suggestions for every semester. It is mainly designed to be used through a Command Line Interface (CLI), although it also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* *Major Features*:
** Suggest available modules based on major requirements and module prerequisites.
** Plan modules for each semester by adding or deleting modules to or from the planner.
** Check module description, prerequisites, and preclusions.

The next few sections will describe my contributions to the project.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to suggest modules to take*
** What it does: allows the user to see the modules he/she is available to take in each semester, based on the modules he/she has taken.
** Justification: This feature helps the user plan modules by checking and listing available modules for him/her.
** Highlights: This is the main feature of our application. It demanded a careful consideration and thorough analysis of several design alternatives and implementation choices. The actual implementation was challenging as it interacted with many other components and commands.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to list modules taken*
** What it does: allows the user to see the modules he/she has added for all years or for each year.
** Justification: This feature helps the user to quickly checks the modules he/she has added.
** Highlights: This feature interacts with other features as the list is updated with each successful execution of add or delete command.

* *Minor enhancement*: removed redundant year and semester arguments from setup command.

== Introduction

Module Planner is for NUS Computer Science undergraduate students who *prefer to use a desktop app* to keep track of past modules and list possible future modules based on the academic requirements. More importantly, Module Planner is optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Module Planner can get your module planning tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== List feature
==== Current Implementation

The list mechanism is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`. `ModulePlanner` stores a list of all `Semester`-s and each `Semester` stores a list `modulesTaken` containing modules that the user has taken or is planning to take.
It implements the following operation:

* `ModulePlanner#listModulesTaken(int index)` -- Retrieves a list of modules from the `Semester` specified by `index`.

The operation is exposed in `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredTakenModuleList(int index)`.

[NOTE]
A valid index should be an integer between 0 to 7 inclusive, where index 0 represents year 1 semester 1, index 1 represents year 1 semester 2, index 2 represents year 2 semester 1, and so on.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism works.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `ModulePlanner` is initialised with 8 `Semester` objects in `List<Module> semesters`.

Step 2. The user executes `add y/1 s/1 CS1231`. The `add` command inserts `Module` CS1231 to the list `modulesTaken` for `Semester` object with index 0.

Step 3. The user wants to see the list of modules for year 1 semester 1 by executing `list y/1 s/1`. The `list` command parses `y/1 s/1` to index 0 and calls `Model#getFilteredTakenModuleList(int index)`.
It will execute `ModulePlanner#listModulesTaken(int index)` which will call `Semester#getModulesTaken()` in the relevant `Semester`. The returned result will be a list of modules and will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How list of modules is retrieved for list command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates list of modules whenever it is modified by a command (e.g. `add`) and immediately retrieves the list upon `list` command.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of running time if commands that modify the list are called frequently.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves all commands that modify list of modules without applying it and updates the list based on the commands only when it is retrieved upon `list` command.
** Pros: May be more effective in terms of running time because it only modifies the list when needed.
** Cons: Implementation will be more complicated as we have to store all commands that modify the list.
