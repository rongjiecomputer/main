By: `Team T16-4`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.planner.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the T16-4 branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1818S1-T16-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1818S1-T16-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API
in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ModulePlannerChangedEvent` when the Module Planner data are changed,
instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results
in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect
the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model`
having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us
reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`,
`ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `FindModulePanel` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching
`.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModulePlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Module Planner data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed'
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// tag::storage[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `ReadOnlyModulePlanner` object in json format and read it back.

.Interactions inside the Storage component for whenever `ModulePlannerChangedEvent` is fired.

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.planner.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Add feature
==== Current Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by 'ModulePlanner'. 'ModulePlanner' stores a list of all 'Semester'-s. A 'Semester' stores a list containing modules that the user has taken or is planning to take on that semester.
The implementation is as follows:

* `ModulePlanner#addModules(List<Module> modules, int index)` -- Add the list of `modules` into the semester specified by `index`.

The operation above is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addModules(List<Module> modules, int index)`

[NOTE]
A valid module is one that exists, has its module specified correctly and has not been taken or planned to take yet by the user.

Below are the possible scenarios of how it works, given a valid module `MA1521` and an invalid module `MA1234`.

===== All valid modules

The user executes `add y/1 s/1 MA1521` to add the `Module` with module code `MA1521` into year 1 semester 1 `Module` lists.
The `add` command calls `Model#addModules(...)`, which adds the module into the `Semester` with index 3.

[NOTE]
This applies to when more than one valid module is supplied.

===== All Invalid Modules
The user executes `add y/1 s/2 MA1234` command. However, since that module does not exist or is already stored in a `Semester`,
the command fails and `Model#addModules(...)` will not be called.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

[NOTE]
This applies to where more than one invalid module is supplied.

===== Some Invalid Modules
The user executes `add y/2 s/1 MA1521 MA1234`. However, only the module `MA1521` is valid.
In this case, the command will not fail entirely and only the valid module `MA1521` will be added.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

===== No Modules
The user executes `add`. As the command has no supplied arguments, the command will fail
and the user will be informed to input arguments.

==== Design Considerations

===== Different semester start
The current implementation only assumes the user is closing into their year 1 semester 1. Further enhancement could be made by having other starting semesters

1. To mirror the real world - it is impossible for a student to void a module that has already been taken.

2. To prevent undefined behaviour - deleting a module already taken might make all future modules not yet taken to be inaccurately planned.
Also, all currently suggested modules to the user might too be inaccurate.


=== Delete feature
==== Current Implementation

The current delete mechanism targets valid modules and is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`.
`ModulePlanner` stores a list of all the semesters the user has taken and will take.
In turn, `Semester` stores a list of the modules the user has taken or will take.

`ModulePlanner` uses the following operation to implement the delete mechanism:

* `ModulePlanner#deleteModules(List<Module> modules)` -- Deletes the modules from whatever semester it is in.

The above operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteModules(List<Module> modules)`

[NOTE]
A valid module is one that exists, has its module code specified correctly and must have not been taken by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Below are some usage scenarios.
For convenience, let's define two modules: a valid module `MA1521` and an invalid module `MA1234`.

===== All Valid Modules
The user executes `delete MA1521` command to delete the `Module` with the module code `MA1521`.
The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteModules(...)`, which removes the module from the semester where it is found.

[NOTE]
This applies to when more than one valid module is supplied.

===== All Invalid Modules
The user executes `delete MA1234` command. However, since that module does not exist,
the command fails and `Model#deleteModules(...)` will not be called.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

[NOTE]
This applies to where more than one invalid module is supplied.

===== Some Invalid Modules
The user executes `delete MA1521 MA1234`. However, only the module `MA1521` is valid.
In this case, the command will not fail entirely and only the valid module `MA1521` will be deleted.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

===== No Modules
The user executes `delete`. As the command has no supplied arguments, the command will fail
and the user will be informed to input arguments.

==== Design Considerations

===== Type of Modules Allowed
Only modules which the user has not taken are allowed to be deleted. There are several reasons:

1. To mirror the real world - it is impossible for a student to void a module that has already been taken.

2. To prevent undefined behaviour - deleting a module already taken might make all future modules not yet taken to be inaccurately planned.
Also, all currently suggested modules to the user might too be inaccurate.

=== List feature
==== Current Implementation

The list mechanism is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`. `ModulePlanner` stores a list of all `Semester`-s and each `Semester` stores a list `modulesTaken` containing modules that the user has taken or is planning to take.
It implements the following operation:

* `ModulePlanner#listModulesTaken(int index)` -- Retrieves a list of modules from the `Semester` specified by `index`.

The operation is exposed in `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredTakenModuleList(int index)`.

[NOTE]
A valid index should be an integer between 0 to 7 inclusive, where index 0 represents year 1 semester 1, index 1 represents year 1 semester 2, index 2 represents year 2 semester 1, and so on.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism works.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `ModulePlanner` is initialised with 8 `Semester` objects in `List<Module> semesters`.

Step 2. The user executes `add y/1 s/1 CS1231`. The `add` command inserts `Module` CS1231 to the list `modulesTaken` for `Semester` object with index 0.

Step 3. The user wants to see the list of modules for year 1 semester 1 by executing `list y/1 s/1`. The `list` command parses `y/1 s/1` to index 0 and calls `Model#getFilteredTakenModuleList(int index)`.
It will execute `ModulePlanner#listModulesTaken(int index)` which will call `Semester#getModulesTaken()` in the relevant `Semester`. The returned result will be a list of modules and will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

image::ListSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How list of modules is retrieved for list command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates list of modules whenever it is modified by a command (e.g. `add`) and immediately retrieves the list upon `list` command.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of running time if commands that modify the list are called frequently.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves all commands that modify list of modules without applying it and updates the list based on the commands only when it is retrieved upon `list` command.
** Pros: May be more effective in terms of running time because it only modifies the list when needed.
** Cons: Implementation will be more complicated as we have to store all commands that modify the list.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedModulePlanner`.
It extends `ModulePlanner` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `modulePlannerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedModulePlanner#commit()` -- Saves the current module planner state in its history.
* `VersionedModulePlanner#undo()` -- Restores the previous module planner state from its history.
* `VersionedModulePlanner#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone module planner state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, `Model#undoModulePlanner()` and `Model#redoModulePlanner()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedModulePlanner` will be initialized with the initial module planner state,
and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single module planner state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the module planner.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, causing the modified state of the module planner
after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `modulePlannerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer`
is shifted to the newly inserted module planner state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, causing another modified module planner state
to be saved into the `modulePlannerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitModulePlanner()`,
so the module planner state will not be saved into the `modulePlannerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake,
and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoModulePlanner()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left,
pointing it to the previous module planner state, and restores the module planner to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial module planner state,
then there are no previous module planner states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoModulePlanner()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoModulePlanner()`,
which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state,
and restores the module planner to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `modulePlannerStateList.size() - 1`,
pointing to the latest module planner state, then there are no undone module planner states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoModulePlanner()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the module planner, such as `list`,
will usually not call `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, `Model#undoModulePlanner()`
or `Model#redoModulePlanner()`. Thus, the `modulePlannerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `modulePlannerStateList`,
all module planner states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire module planner.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of module planner states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedModulePlanner`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// tag::moduleinfo[]
=== Retrieval and Use of Module Information

Information of a NUS module such as module code, module credit and prerequisite modules are stored in `ModuleInfo` class.
This class is made to be immutable to avoid accidental changes to the class.

A python script (link:{repoURL}/tools/moduleConverter.py[`moduleConverter.py`]) is used to download the list of NUS modules
from NUSMods server, do some data transformation and write to `data/moduleInfo.json` for the use of our app.

NUSMods provides the prerequisites and preclusion of a module in normal English sentence (e.g. "CS1010 or its equivalents"
and "Departmental approval"), attempting to extract the correct prerequisite and preclusion relationship of the modules
would be infeasible due to the potential long list of exception rules. Therefore, we will only extract the module codes
in the sentences with regular expression, downside of this is that we won't include CS1010S, CS1010J and so on from
"CS1010 or its equivalents". We will also assume that if any module in the prerequisite/preclusion list is matched,
the condition is met immediately (even though this is incorrect for rules like "(MA1101R AND MA1221) OR MA1521").

`ModuleInfoRetriever` opens the processed `data/moduleInfo.json` file packaged in the JAR file and deserialize its
content into an array of `ModuleInfo` objects. As JSON can only hold simple values such as strings and numbers,
prerequisites and preclusion are stored as an array of `String`, so we need to call `ModuleInfo.finalizeModuleInfo` to
convert the strings into `ModuleInfo`s as well before we can start querying prerequisite and preclusion from
`ModuleInfo#getPrerequisites` and `ModuleInfo#getPreclusions`.

For command implementer, you can access the complete list of `ModuleInfo` from `ModuleInfo#getModuleInfoList()`.
You can convert a module code string to a `ModuleInfo` object by passing the string to
`ModuleInfo#getFromModuleCode(String code)`.
// end::moduleinfo[]

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.planner.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.planner.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.planner.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.planner.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Module Planner depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
